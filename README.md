# WhatsApp Chat Displayer  
This is an application that allows users to read an exported WhatsApp Chat in the default .txt format.  
### Features
  - Drag & Drop functionality.  
  - Custom UI similar to a real WhatsApp Chat.  
  - Custom Parser.  
### Parser
This is the brain of the application I've written located at js/parse.js. This is a class based structure that loops through all characters inside the chat file and generates:  
  - Messages List.  
  - Users List.  

Each message contains:

  - Date.  
  - Time.  
  - User.  
  - Message.
